## Energy
Energy usage in Space Fights distinguishes it from other games in the genre. Most gamers are accustomed to separate weapon cooldowns, shields, health, and repair mechanics; however, Space Fights integrates all of this into one attribute. A blue bar above your ship indicates the current energy of the ship. This value decreases when firing a weapon, receiving damage, or using the Rhino's speed boost. This renders PvP as a fast-paced mind game since you donâ€™t want to accidentally overshoot. Doing so would make you vulnerable to a 1-shot kill because your energy drains by firing projectiles. Each of the different ship classes has their own base energy balanced with respect to their combat abilities.

## Current Classes
* Vulture (nimble ONE-shot assassin)
* Lion (slothy bullet tank)
* Rhino (physical damage focused ramming ship)

## Controller Requirements:
