## Energy
Energy usage in Space Fights distinguishes it from other games in the genre. Most gamers are accustomed to separate weapon cooldowns, shields, health, and repair mechanics; however, Space Fights integrates all of this into one value. A blue bar above your ship indicates the current energy of the ship. This value decreases when using the Rhino’s thrust special (for a speed boost), firing a weapon, or receiving damage. This means that PvP is also a mind game where you don’t want to accidentally overshoot. Doing so would make you vulnerable to a 1-shot kill because your energy was drained by the gun. Each of the different ship classes has their own base energy balanced with respect to their combat abilities.
